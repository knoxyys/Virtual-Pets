class Pet():
    def __init__(self):
        self.dead = False

####----Task 1----####
#Set up your pet with the following attributes:
#name (make this mandatory), age (default:0), hunger (default: 5), boredom (default:3), sleepiness(default:3)

####----Task 2----####
#instantiate your pet object with the name of your choice

####----Task 3----#### 
# We need to add the following methods to our Virtual Pet:
# 1. Feed - which will reduce hunger by 3
# use a selection to make sure if hunger goes below zero it gets reset to 0 (we don’t want any negative numbers.)
# 2. Play - which will reduce boredom by 3
# 3. Sleep - which will reduce sleepiness by 5
# 4. Wait - which will increase age, and increase hunger, boredom and sleepiness
# 5. Is_dead - which will check to see if the Pet has hit the thresholds we have set as the
# maximum possible hunger, boredom and sleepiness

###----Task 4----####
# Make a new method called check_death() that checks when a pet dies.
# These are the conditions I have chosen to use to determine if the pet should be dead.
# (Note: you can change these to make your pet harder or easier to keep alive)
    # ● Boredom is at 10
    # ● Sleepiness is at 10
    # ● Hunger is at 10
    # ● Age is at a random age between 15 and 20 or more


####---Task 5----####
#make it so that the feed, sleep, play and wait will check if the pet
#is dead before you upadate those properties.

####---Task 6----####
#Use Python's predefined __str__ method to produce a string output
#for your pet. refer to page 4 of the tutorial if you don't know
#what I'm talking about.
